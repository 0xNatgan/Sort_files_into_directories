Intended to solve a problem i had.
If it helps you that's nice !
If you need help with this code don't hesitate to ask.

Copy the python file in the same directory as the one you want to sort 
as 
Dir
 |
 | -> To_sort
 | -> FileSort.py
 
Just call the script with 
```python3 FileSort.py [directory to sort]```
the [directory to sort should be the name of the directory as in the example ```To_sort```

feel free to use/change/share/upgrade this code.
